# SAMO_UQGSAPFA_CODES
This repository includes the MATLAB CODES and finite element analysis (FEA) files for stochastic analysis for Progressive Failure of Composites using Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) presented in the paper titled: "Uncertainty Quantification and Global Sensitivity Analysis for Progressive Failure of Fiber-Reinforced Composites"

Authors: Mishal Thapa, Achyut Paudel, Sameer B. Mulani, Robert W. Walters (Under Review in: Structural Multidisciplinary and Optimization journal, 2020)

The MATLAB CODES contain:
->Validation codes for the deterministic Progressive Failure Analysis (PFA) along with the stochastic PFA analysis using Monte Carlo Simulation with Latin Hypercube sampling and Polynomial Chaos Expansion for three load cases-uniaxial tension, uniaxial compression, and out-of-plane transverse loading.

->Codes for global sensitivity analysis (GSA) by estimating the Sobol indices.
